Why did I make this? Honestly, I just wanted to do a project I could finish in a 2-3 hours max. I saw the tweet and it made me laugh, and I figured it'd be easy enough to make a digital version. A solid chunk of the time was spent trying to avoid using gigantic dependencies like nodejs or npm for a tiny project, but I think that paid off. The site looks fine and loads lightning quick (at least on my connection), which is the most important thing to me.
